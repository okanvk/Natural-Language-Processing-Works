In the folder, next to its name use the drop down menu to select `\"Add shortcut to Drive\" -> \"My Drive\" and then press ADD SHORTCUT`. This should add a shortcut to the folder `NLP C4 W3 Data` within your own google drive. Please make sure this happens, as you'll be reading the data for this notebook from this folder.\n","\n","- Make sure your runtime is GPU (_not_ CPU or TPU).
